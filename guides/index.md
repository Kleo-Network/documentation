# About Kleo 
Kleo uses public key cryptography to store your private / personal information, 
nobody without the signature can access your information. 

Although in order to protect user privacy we need to ensure that NO PII (Personally Identifiable Information) gets leaked about you. In order to ensure that, we run computations on stored data using LLM APIs on distributed TEE (Truster Executable Environment) with no manual intervention. Once the PII is removed then the entire history is encrypted with user's metamask signature and stored publicly on chain using IPFS.
