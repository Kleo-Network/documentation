#### Step 1: Remove PII
Kleo is a simple extension which can be installed in any extension. We first remove all the Personally Identifiable Information (Names, Emails, Phones, Addresses, etc. [FULL LIST](/kleo_network/pii) ) - this makes your entire data psuedoanonymous, and thus cannot be triangulated back to the user. This is ensured with help of LLMs (Large Language Models). 

#### Step 2: Owning stake in $KLEO
Kleo chooses to define proof of contribution based on what users like to showcase from their consumption identity on platforms like twitter. These cards are generated when you click on the extension, and sharing them helps create a consumption data passport for you. This gives you KLEO XP Points

It's ensured that these cards are impossible to correlate to original information. 

#### Step 3: Owning stake in LLM Agents / Data Marketplaces / Data Aggregators
This depends on requirement of the data. Kleo and VANA DAO will come up with a proof of contribution which will then decide on user contribution tokens/$ amount will be shared.  

#### Step 4: Lets' Earn
You can claim your points from our dashboard to earn KLEO points!
