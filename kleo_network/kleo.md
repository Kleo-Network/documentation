# About Kleo Network
Kleo Network is a Data Liquidity Provider (DLP) for [VANA Protocol](https://vana.org/). We want users to own their own consumption data with help of an extension. 

## Benefits of owning this data
Kleo Network and VANA wants you to have equity in AI agents, data marketplaces, data aggregators where community created data is being utilised by these organisations without permission and sneakily snuck in lengthy terms and conditions. 
**We want to get your data go and work for you while you sleep.**

## How does this work?

#### Step 1: Remove PII
Kleo is a simple extension which can be installed. We first remove all the Personally Identifiable Information (Names, Emails, Phones, Addresses, etc. [FULL LIST](/kleo_network/pii) ) - this makes your entire data psuedoanonymous, and thus cannot be triangulated back to the user. This is ensured with help of LLM (Large Language Models). 

#### Step 2: Owning stake in $KLEO
Kleo chooses to define proof of contribution based on what users like to showcase from their consumption identity on platforms like twitter/telegram. These cards are generated when you click on the extension, and sharing them helps create a consumption data passport for you. The $KLEO token can be exchanged for $USDC. 

It's ensured that these cards are impossible to correlate to original information. 

#### Step 3: Owning stake in LLM Agents / Data Marketplaces / Data Aggregators
This depends on requirement of the data. Kleo and VANA DAO will come up with a proof of contribution which will then decide on user contribution tokens/$ amount will be shared.  

#### Step 4: Lets' Earn
Share and earn boys, share and earn!
