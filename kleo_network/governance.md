# Governance
There are two specific datasets that the organisations can request to access, 
- Data Identity Information of a specific user. 
- Pooled Data Information 

### Governance for Data Identity Information for specific user.

This essentially means personal data information which can be shared over simple popup, the consent of it is directly from the end user themselves. This is currently served over cookie like popups to access user data using NLP (natural language processing.) sentences. Sentences like "what kind of movies is this user interested in?", "has the user looked up about cricket world cup?"...Depending on the privacy settings and depth of the question, it will be paid/free. 

If the organisation is doing something novel, or wants to bypass the restrictions. They can choose to open a snapshot voting proposal about accessing user data without paying the user but showing how it benefits the user itself. If approved by community, then they have the permission to access this user data. 

### Governance for Pooled Data

Any pooled data requests will be approved only if two conditions are met, 
- The organisation stakes 3000 $KLEO tokens on AVS 
- The organisation proposes a snapshot proposal on what they intent to do with that data. 

The organisation will receive an APY of 6% for staking KLEO tokens. Although if it's found that the data was misapprpiated then the stake will be slashed. This data will be real time data.
