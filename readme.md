# About Kleo Network
Kleo Network is data DAO for user consumption data. It enables users to own and earn from their data.<br/><br/>
It's also a Data Liquidity Provider (DLP) for [VANA Protocol](https://vana.org/). 

## Benefits of owning this data
Kleo Network and VANA wants you to have equity in AI agents, data marketplaces, data aggregators where community created data is being utilised to drive economic value. Kleo has firm belief that this is unfair to the community, and thus should be addressed immediately. 


**We want your data to go and work for you while you sleep.**


This is documentation for understanding the Kleo Network architecture and building on top of it. It addresses issues such as ownership, privacy, token distribution, data decryption and use cases for Kleo.
