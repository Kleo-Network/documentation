In order to ensure that, we run computations on stored data using LLM APIs on distributed TEE (Truster Executable Environment) with no manual intervention. Once the PII is removed then the entire history is encrypted with user's metamask signature and stored publicly on chain using IPFS."]}],[{"i":"how-to-access-public-information-using-kleo-sdk","l":"How to access public information using Kleo SDK?"}],[{"l":"Token"},{"l":"Contribution and measuring quality of data submitted to data DAO","p":["In order to validate the data kleo runs multiple data checks which are confidential.
