Higher uniqueness indicates that the content or activity is less common and therefore more valuable."]},{"l":"Nature of Activity","p":["The nature of activity considers the type of actions a user performs. Not all activities are treated equally; for instance, activities like “doom scrolling” or passive browsing receive lower value as they lack engagement or productivity. The algorithm prioritizes activities that add more value, such as creating content, engaging meaningfully, or contributing to discussions."]},{"l":"AIable","p":["This factor evaluates whether the actions a user performs can be replicated by AI models. If the actions are complex, creative, or require human intuition—something that AI cannot easily replicate—the contribution is scored higher.
